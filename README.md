# Steepest-Descent-Finite-Difference
Optimization with steepest descent &amp; finite difference (also Hessian calculation)

ideas for improvement: 
Basin-hopping is a global optimization technique that iterates by performing random perturbation of coordinates, performing local optimization, and accepting or rejecting new coordinates based on a minimized function value.
