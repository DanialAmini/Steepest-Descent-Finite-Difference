for example use the flood time series from USGS to train a neural network

for flood station

or for rain
for temperature (seasonal, annual trends)


another useful thing is double & single pendulum which can be used for practicing forcasting neural networks but it doesn't have scientific value as it has been done many times before. 

The system of equations can be solved quite easily using time marching algorithms. I don't know but I think time marching algorithms also exist. I don't know if it has an exact solution too or no. there is an exact solution

another application is inverted pendulum which I'm sure has uses in control systems if you build a neural network thing on top of it. or the operation of a windfarm.
