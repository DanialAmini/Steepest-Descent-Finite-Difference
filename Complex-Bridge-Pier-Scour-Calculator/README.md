Visual Basic Application:

The VB app for calculating scour around bridge piers - supports several rows of data is explained below.

The explanation can be found in a paper entitled "Scour depth calculator explained in paper entitled "Estimating scour depth around complex piers using soft computing methods: A comparative study" by Danial Amini Baghbadorani1, Aliasghar Beheshti and Behzad Ataie-Ashtiani, Under consideration for publication in Journal of Waterway, Port, Coastal, and Ocean Engineering - ASCE, Dec. 2018"

The complex pier parameters, including column width, pile cap width and thickness, extension of pile cap in front of column, pile group configuration (number of piles and pile diamater and spacing) as well as flow (depth, velocity) and sediment size are taken as inputs and the scour depth of complex pier is calculated.

Four soft computing methods are used: NN, SVM, GP and ANFIS. The program is like a small spreadsheet.
